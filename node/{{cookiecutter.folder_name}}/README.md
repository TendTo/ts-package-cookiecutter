### üßæ Requirements

- [node.js 14.x](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or similar package manager)

#### Notable dev-dependencies

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make programming decent
- [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) for building the package
- [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end to end tests
- [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for unit tests

### üîß Setup

Install the dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

### üåê Standalone web server

To play around and see for yourself any changes to the library, you can use the integrated web server.
Just run

```bash
# Build the package locally and start the web server
npm run build:dev
npm start
# Allows live reload by refreshing the page
npm run start:dev
```

### üß± Build

Make sure everything is clean by running

```bash
npm run clean
```

then all the versions of the package can be built with the command

```bash
npm run build
```

### üß™ Tests

#### Unit

After having installed the dependencies, run

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

#### E2E

After having installed the dependencies, complete the setup required by playwright with

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

you can then run

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The e2e test configuration is located in _config/playwright.config.ts_.
> Right now, only chromium and firefox are tested, but it is possible to also include safari (see commented section).
